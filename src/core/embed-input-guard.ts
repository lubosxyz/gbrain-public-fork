/**
 * Pre-embed input ceiling — the last gate before a text reaches an embedder.
 *
 * Why this exists (KOM-287): stored chunks are not guaranteed to respect the
 * chunker's cap. `content_chunks` rows written by an older chunker version
 * outlive the upgrade that introduced `DEFAULT_MAX_CHUNK_TOKENS`, and several
 * paths (`embed-stale`, `migrate-engine`, the re-embed sweeps) recycle
 * `chunk_text` verbatim without ever re-measuring it. So the embed path must
 * assume nothing about what the chunker produced and check for itself.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GUARANTEES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.
 *
 * It guarantees the embed path never SPENDS a provider call on a text that
 * already blows gbrain's own declared chunk budget. It does NOT guarantee the
 * provider will accept everything that passes, and treating it as if it did
 * would be a bug. The estimator is cl100k (`estimateEmbedTokens`), which is
 * the tokenizer OpenAI's embedders use; other embedders tokenize the same
 * bytes very differently. Measured against `ollama:bge-m3` (XLM-RoBERTa
 * SentencePiece, 8192-token context) on real HTML/JS chunks:
 *
 *     chunk  chars  cl100k tokens  bge-m3 verdict
 *     4437    6053           1926  accepted
 *     4435    6053           1943  REJECTED (over 8192)
 *     3853    6057           2250  accepted
 *     3851    6057           2224  REJECTED (over 8192)
 *
 * The two classes OVERLAP: 2250 cl100k tokens fit while 1943 did not. No
 * cl100k threshold — and no character threshold either, those pairs are the
 * same length — separates them. A foreign tokenizer's verdict simply cannot
 * be predicted from a local estimate, which is why the reactive half of the
 * fix (`AIInputTooLargeError` + parking the chunk) is load-bearing rather
 * than a fallback. This module is the cheap first line; it is not the
 * guarantee.
 *
 * The cap is therefore expressed as gbrain's OWN invariant — "no chunk may
 * exceed the chunker's budget" — not as a model's context window. Operators
 * running a strict embedder can tighten it via
 * `GBRAIN_MAX_EMBED_INPUT_TOKENS` to trade recall for round-trips.
